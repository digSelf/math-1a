# Calculus 1A (001 LEC) Fall 2019

## Textbook

The textbook for this course is: **Stewart, *Single Variable Calculus: Early Transcendentals for UC Berkeley***, 8th edition (ISBN: 9781305765276, Cengage).

This is a custom edition containing chapters 1-9, 11 and 17 of Stewart's "Calculus: Early Transcendentals", 8th edition. The regular edition is also fine, it just contains extra chapters covered in math 53. The 7th edition is also acceptable, but you will need to watch for differences in the numbering of assigned homework problems. In chronological order, we'll cover material in chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
